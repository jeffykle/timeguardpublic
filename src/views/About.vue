                    <b>TimeGuard</b> is a remote time management aid which allows you to create timers (TimeGuards) which each have a unique URL which can be shared with any number of "Client" users. Signed in users can create multiple timer instances that run concurrently.
                </p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center mb-3">
            <div class="col col-md-8 col-lg-6 text-left about">                
                <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item "><p>
                    When you create a TimeGuard, you will be asked for a name. It is recommended that you give it the first name of the person it is intended for. You will then be able to set a timer for that TimeGuard. 
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item "><p>
                    At this phase you can follow the "See the Client View" link to preview what a Client user would see. There is also a button to copy the link to your clipboard for easy sharing with the intended user.
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item "><p>
                    Each TimeGuard has a visual status indicator that will be green if any users have the Client View open on their machine. A count of all Client users is also displayed. When a user firsts opens the Client view, they are automatically subscribed to desktop notifications for that TimeGuard.
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item "><p>
                    Client users have an option to unsubscribe from each TimeGuard, which will stop further notifications and remove the TimeGuard as an active connection.
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item "><p>
                    The TimeGuards also have a button which allows you to "Ping" any client users that are subscribed. Please note that subscribed users are not the same as active users. That means that even if you show no active connections, some Clients may still receive desktop notifications if they are subscribed. 
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item "><p>
                    In future releases we plan to validate the receipt of the Ping action, regardless of whether or not the Client user is active. Please note that you will also be subscribed to a TimeGuard and receive notifications, even if you are the user that created it and are initiating the Ping.
                </p></li>
